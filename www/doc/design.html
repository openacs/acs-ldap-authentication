<h3>II.  Introduction</h3>

The LDAP Authentication package is intended to provide a service such that,
after registering once, a user can log on to multiple ACS installations via the
same e-mail address and password.

<p>

It is very common to have separate, but similar ACS installations, such as
www.arsdigita.com and acs.arsdigita.com.  As it is now, in order to use these
sites you need to create a separate account on each site.  Then you must
remember the e-mail address and password you used for each site.  You may have
used the same e-mail address and password for both to make it easier to remember,
but then if you ever want to change your password on one site then they'll be
out of sync again.

<p>

ArsDigita, as the administrator of these two sites can use the LDAP
authentication package to create "canonical accounts" that are shared between
the sites.  The canonical accounts are the authoritative source for a user's
primary information such as e-mail address, password, first names, and last
name.  Each ACS installation (www.arsdigita.com and acs.arsdigita.com in this
example) still have their own users table, but they use the LDAP authentication
to keep their local user information fresh.

<p>

With LDAP Authentication enabled, when Joe User registers on www.arsdigita.com,
a local entry is created as well as a canonical entry on the LDAP server.  Then,
when Joe tries to log into acs.arsdigita.com, the LDAP server will be queried and
Joe's information will be found.  Additionally, a local entry will be created on
acs.arsdigita.com with Joe's info.  If Joe were to change his password on
acs.arsdigita.com, the password on the LDAP server would also be updated, which
implicitly propagates the change to www.arsdigita.com.  Finally, ArsDigita could
at a later point enable LDAP Authentication on wimpy.arsdigita.com, and everyone
with an account on acs.arsdigita.com/www.arsdigita.com could then log into
wimpy.

<h3>III.  Historical Considerations</h3>

In terms of protocols, the only choices analyzed to solve this problem were LDAP
and Oracle Replication.  Oracle Replication would have been a more full-featured
and easy-to-implement solution, but it was rejected due to its rigid and proprietary
nature.  LDAP is a much more flexible and open choice.

<h3>IV.  Competitive Analysis</h3>

<h3>V.  Design Tradeoffs</h3>

<h3>VIII.  API</h3> 

<p>
The API to the permissions system consists of a few well-known tables,
plus a pair of PL/SQL procedures and a pair of tcl functions.
</p>

<h4>Tables</h4>

<p>
<tt>acs_methods</tt>, <tt>acs_privileges</tt>, and
<tt>acs_privilege_method_rules</tt> manage the set of permissions in
the system.  A package will add to these three tables to introduce new
permissions into the system at package installation time.
</p>

<p>
The main table for queries is <tt>acs_object_party_method_map</tt>,
which contains (<i>object</i>, <i>party</i>, <i>method</i>) triples
for all allowed operations in the system.
</p>

<p>
Also of interest for queries is <tt>acs_permissions</tt>, which lists
directly granted privileges.  Neither
<tt>acs_object_party_method_map</tt> (which is a view) nor
<tt>acs_permissions</tt> should be updated directly.
</p>

<h4>PL/SQL Procedures</h4>

<p>
<tt>acs_permissions.grant_permission</tt> introduces new permissions
for an object.  It should be given an (<i>object</i>, <i>party</i>,
<i>privilege</i>) triple, and will always succeed.  If the permission
is already in the system, no change occurs.  The interface for this
procedure is:
</p>

<pre>
procedure grant_permission (
  object_id    acs_permissions.object_id%TYPE,
  grantee_id   acs_permissions.grantee_id%TYPE,
  privilege    acs_permissions.privilege%TYPE
);
</pre>

<p>
<tt>acs_permissions.revoke_permission</tt> removes a permission entry
given a triple.  It always succeeds--if a permission does not exist,
nothing changes.  The interface for this procedure is:
</p>

<pre>
procedure revoke_permission (
  object_id    acs_permissions.object_id%TYPE,
  grantee_id   acs_permissions.grantee_id%TYPE,
  privilege    acs_permissions.privilege%TYPE
);
</pre>

<p>
These procedures are defined in <a
href="http://acs40.arsdigita.com/doc/sql/display-sql?url=permissions-create.sql&package_key=acs-kernel"><tt>permissions-create.sql</tt></a>

<h4>Tcl Procedures</h4>

<p>
Two tcl procedures provide a simple call for the "can this user
perform this method on this object" query.  One returns true or false,
the other presents an error page.
</p>

<p>
To receive a true or false value, tcl code should call:
</p>

<pre>
ad_permission_p $object_id $object_type $method -user_id $user_id
</pre>

<p>
If the <tt>user_id</tt> argument is left out, then the currently
logged in user is checked.  To create an error page, tcl code should call:
</p>

<pre>
ad_require_permission $object_id $object_type $method
</pre>

<p>
These procedures are defined in <tt>acs-permissions-procs.tcl</tt>.
</p>

<h3>VII.  Data Model Discussion</h3>

<p> The LDAP Authentication data model contains only one table -
<code>ldap_attributes</code>.  This table keeps a list of LDAP attributes for
individual ACS objects.  Currently there are just two columns -
<code>object_id</code> and <code>dn</code>.  With these columns, we can map a
Distinguished Name (dn) to any ACS object in the database.  </p>

<p> The bulk of the functionality of the LDAP data model comes from its PL/SQL
functions.  These functions are wrappers around Java functions that perform
specific operations on the LDAP server.  The functions are:

<dl>
 <dt>acs_ldap.authenticate</dt>
 <dd>Given a DN and password, determines whether the password is valid for that
  DN.</dd>
 <dt>acs_ldap.change_password</dt>
 <dd>Given a DN and password, updates the password on the LDAP server of the
  entry designated by the DN.</dd>
 <dt>acs_ldap.get_attribute</dt>
 <dd>Given a DN and attribute name, query the entry on the LDAP server for its
  value of the specified attribute. This function only supports entries that
  return exactly one attribute value.</dd>
 <dt>acs_ldap.get_dn_from_email</dt>
 <dd>Given an email address, queries the LDAP server for an entry whose mail
  attribute matches the email address.  If successul, returns the DN of the
  matched entry.</dd>
 <dt>acs_ldap.add_user</dt>
 <dd>Takes in a DN and first_names, last_name, email, and password values.  It
  then creates an entry on the LDAP server with the given DN and other attribute
  values.</dd>
</dl>

In addition, all of these functions take some combination of the following
parameters which are necessary to establish the LDAP environment for the Java
calls.
<dl>
 <dt>url</dt>
 <dd>This is the url of the ldap server.  e.g) ldap://yourldapserver.com:389</dd>
 <dt>rootdn</dt>
 <dd>This is the DN of a user on the LDAP server that has permissions to query,
  modify, and add entries on the server.</dd>
 <dt>rootpw</dt>
 <dd>The password for the user specified by the rootdn</dd>
 <dt>basedn</dt>
 <dd>The base object in the LDAP server where queries start. e.g.) o=arsdigita.com</dd>
 <dt>security_method</dt>
 <dd>The level of security to use.  Valid values include 'none', 'simple', and
  'strong'.  However, many LDAP servers do not support 'strong' authentication.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>VIII.  User Interface</h3>

<p>
All users of the permissions system are the same at the user-interface
level.  If you have the <tt>administer_privileges</tt> method
permission on an object, then you may edit privileges for that object
with the user interface.
</p>

<p>
The user interface currently provides a list of all granted
permissions on the object.  If the user wishes to revoke privileges,
she may select a set of grants, choose revoke, confirm their deletion,
and be returned to the same page after those privileges have been
revoked.
</p>

<p>
Granting currently works by providing a list of all possible
permissions and a list of all parties in the system.  In the future,
of course, some search mechanism is necessary.  After choosing
privileges to grant, the user is returned to the edit privileges for
one object screen.
</p>

<p>
If it makes sense, the system will also display a checkbox which the
user may select to toggle whether permissions are inherited from the
object's context.
</p>

<p>
There are a number of potential future enhancements for this UI.
</p>

<h3>IX.  Configuration/Parameters</h3>

<p>
There are no configuration options for the permissions system.
</p>

<h3>X.  Acceptance Tests</h3>

<p>...</p>

<h3>XI.  Future Improvements/Areas of Likely Change</h3>

<p>
The most important future changes to the system are likely to be to
the user interface.  Here's a list of likely changes:
</p>

<ul>
 <li>
  There should probably be a page displaying a list of all objects for
  which the current user is allowed to administer privileges.
 </li>
 <li>
  Users should probably be able to view the permissions on any object,
  or perhaps on objects which they have the "read_permissions" method.
  This would allow them to see what grants are effecting their objects
  through inheritance.
 </li>
</ul>
